Sceneform is a 3D framework with a physically based renderer that's optimized
for mobile devices and that makes it easy for you to build augmented reality
apps without requiring OpenGL or Unity.

This repository is the continuation of the [Archived version](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk)

## Usage benefits
* Continuous compatibility with the latests versions of [ARCore SDK](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk) and [Filament](https://github.com/google/filament) 
* Based on AndroidX
* Avaiable has jCenter dependencies 
* Supports <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">glTF</a> instead of olds <code>SFA</code> and <code>SFB</code> formats 
* Open source 


## Dependencies

Sceneform is available on `jCenter()`

```gradle
//Scenform Core
implementation("com.gorisse.thomas.sceneform:core:1.18.0")
//Scenform Fragment
implementation("com.gorisse.thomas.sceneform:ux:1.18.0")
```

## Usage

Check out the [Full source code samples](https://github.com/ThomasGorisse/sceneform-android-sdk/tree/master/samples).

### Update your AndroidManifest.xml

Modify your ```AndroidManifest.xml``` to indicate that your app uses (AR Optional) or requires (AR Required) ARCore and CAMERA access:
```xml
<!-- Both "AR Optional" and "AR Required" apps require CAMERA permission. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

<!-- Sceneform requires OpenGL ES 3.0 or later. -->
<uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00030000" android:required="true" />

<!-- Indicates that app requires ARCore ("AR Required"). Ensures the app is
     visible only in the Google Play Store on devices that support ARCore.
     For "AR Optional" apps remove this line. -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.ar" />

<application>
    â€¦
    <!-- Indicates that app requires ARCore ("AR Required"). Causes the Google
         Play Store to download and install Google Play Services for AR along
         with the app. For an "AR Optional" app, specify "optional" instead of
         "required".
    -->
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.ar.core" android:value="required" />
</application>
```

### Add the fragment to your layout
```xml
<fragment android:name="com.google.ar.sceneform.ux.ArFragment"
      android:id="@+id/ux_fragment"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

### Add your renderable
```kotlin
 ModelRenderable.builder()
    .setSource(
        this,
        // Http source
        Uri.parse("https://storage.googleapis.com/ar-answers-in-search-models/static/Tiger/model.glb")
        // Or raw resource : model.glb
        // R.raw.model
    )
    .setIsFilamentGltf(true)
    .build()
    .thenAccept { modelRenderable: ModelRenderable? ->
        activity.renderable = modelRenderable
    }
    .exceptionally { throwable: Throwable? ->
        Toast.makeText(this, "Unable to load renderable", Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
        null
    }
```

## OLD - Choosing the right Sceneform SDK version for your project

As of ARCore release 1.16.0, Google open-sourced the implementation of Sceneform
allowing to extend Sceneform's features and capabilities. As part of the
1.16.0 release, support for `SFA` and `SFB` assets was removed in favor of
adding `glTF` support

You can continue to use Sceneform 1.15.0 (or earlier). There is no requirement
that you migrate to Sceneform 1.16.0.

Do not use Sceneform 1.17.0 as that release will not work correctly. (Sceneform
1.17.1 can be used, but is otherwise identical to Sceneform 1.15.0.)
